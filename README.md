# OpenCV_HW
Exercise 1:
we can access the pixel value of cvMat by 1)using the pointer, 2)the indexing operator, 3)using Matlterator object, 4)using the .at(x,y) where x, y is the row and col of matrix. 

For the RGB picture, there are 3 color channels called B,G,R and we need to multiply the number of column and the number of rows to scan the matrix.
